# Does Company Culture increase Shareholder Value?
### An analysis of Glassdoor's "Best Places to Work" Companies and their stock performance. 

#### Great company culture is tough to implement and may be overlooked or dismissed when running a company. There is no doubt that great company culture is necessary for the longevity of a company’s success but I was curious whether that translated into shareholder value (stock appreciation) and by how much. There are many factors to assess when looking to invest in a company, but I believe company culture could be one of the biggest value drivers and should be closely analyzed, especially for a long-term investor. Why? Culture is not a short term catalyst but a long term competitive advantage. Great company culture means the employees are feeling secure and happy with the environment they work in everyday and these types of environments tend to facilitate employee productivity and innovation, ultimately increasing shareholder value/economic value. 

# Scrape
#### In order to measure company culture, I scraped “Top Large” companies in Glassdoor’s “Best Places to Work” from years 2009-2019. To measure stock performance, I only looked at public companies that were elected to “Best Places to Work” and scraped www.buyupside.com/stockreturncalculator/stockreturncalcinput.php for their annualized stock returns.
